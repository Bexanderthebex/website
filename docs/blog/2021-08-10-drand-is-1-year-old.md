Drand, the distributed randomness beacon, introduced to serve as a foundational randomness service for the Internet, surpassed 1M rounds on July 7, 2021! Drand mainnet was launched in July 2020 and received a significant update on August 10, 2020. This update included a number of key features, such as its 3-layer network architecture, client implementations in Go, and Javascript, _round to timestamp_ guarantees, deployment monitoring, and [may other improvements](https://drand.love/blog/2020/08/10/drand-launches-v1-0/).

We’ve got two reasons to celebrate today:

- Drand celebrates its first anniversary since the launch of a significant upgrade to the mainnet on August 10, 2020, that enabled it to be used as a production-grade network! Drand has served as a piece of critical and off-chain infrastructure for [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io) (the world’s largest decentralized storage network and verifiable marketplace) since its mainnet launch in Oct 2020 and several other projects in Web3 and beyond.
- Drand has been running smoothly without disruptions since its launch in July 2020 and recently completed 1M rounds - a significant milestone for this distributed randomness service for Web3 and the Internet at large! We would like to thank the [League of Entropy](https://drand.love/blog/2020/08/10/drand-launches-v1-0/) members, a collection of independent randomness beacon providers who work together to produce collective, publicly verifiable, unbiased, and unpredictable random values at fixed intervals using bilinear pairings, and threshold cryptography.

There are also several reasons that _you_ should be excited about the future of drand, which include:

- An exciting roadmap of new capabilities planned such as:
    - _Time-lock-encryption_ for mitigating threats related to maximal extractable value (MEV), also known as _front running_, in DeFi and traditional financial exchanges
    - Availability of a higher frequency randomness beacon, running in parallel to the current 30-second beacon. This update will enable drand to be leveraged by a broader set of use cases across Web2 and Web3.
    - Expanding the global distribution network operated by a growing number of Drand partners as part of the League of Entropy.
    - New collaborations with projects in the Web3 and DeFi spaces that aim to enable applications across multiple ecosystems to leverage Drand as a reliable and trustworthy source of randomness in a convenient and effective manner
- A new Project Lead has joined the drand team who will focus on driving future development, and growth of drand in collaboration with the League of Entropy.
- Drand is hiring! The team is looking for top talent to join our efforts to establish drand as the default random value generator for the Internet. Open positions include Senior Software Engineer in Distributed Systems, and Infrastructure Engineer. [Take a look at our open roles](https://jobs.lever.co/protocol?team=Engineering).

Stay tuned for more exciting updates!

Onwards to 2M rounds, and beyond!
