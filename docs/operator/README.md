# Operator

This section contains information for drand node operators - the people deploying and maintaining drand networks.
For information about consuming the randomness from a drand network, see the [Developer's Guide](/developer/) instead.

The following guides are available:

- A [deployment guide](/operator/deploy/) that shows how to set up a drand network and perform necessary maintenance.
- A [metrics guide](/operator/metrics/) that shows how to monitor a running network.

::: warning
As of Q2'22, the drand network operated by the [League of Entropy (LoE)](https://blog.cloudflare.com/league-of-entropy/) is running a testnet that integrates support for multi-frequency beacons and unchained randomness. You can read all the details in [this blogpost](https://drand.love/blog/2022/02/21/multi-frequency-support-and-timelock-encryption-capabilities/). The documentation in this site has been updated to include mention of these features, although they are not currently supported in LoE's drand mainnet. All changes are backward compatible. We expect that mainnet will switch to unchained randomness and support for multi-frequency beacons in Q4'22.
