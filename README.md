# Drand Docs Beta

This repo is home to the beta version of the IPFS next-gen documentation platform, built on top of [VuePress](https://github.com/vuejs/vuepress).

## Want to contribute to Drand Docs?

**We'd love your contributions! Right now, all open documentation issues and help-wanted items (including bounty items!) can be found in the [main Drand Documentation repo](https://github.com/ipfs/docs).** As the beta site being iterated upon in this `ipfs-docs-v2` repo comes out of beta, we'll migrate it into the main Drand Docs repo.

## Working on this beta platform

As noted above, if you'd like to contribute to the Drand Docs effort as a whole, please have a look at the issues and other notes (including bounty items!) in the [main Drand Documentation repo](https://github.com/ipfs/docs). If you just want to spin up a local instance of this beta VuePress site, see below:

1. Install the NPM dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Boot up the application in _dev mode_:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. Open [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

## Issues

Any issues found within this repo should be listed in the [`ipfs/docs` issues tracker](https://github.com/ipfs/docs/issues). This repository will be merged into the `ipfs/docs` repository in quarter 2 of 2020. Having all the issues in one place will help to keep things organized. It also enables us to retain the commit history of `ipfs/docs`. Once the merge is complete, this repository will be archived.
